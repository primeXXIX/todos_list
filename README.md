**To Do List**

Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

Can build basic websites with HTML & CSS
Can add behavior to a website with JavaScript
Have a basic familiarity with SQL
Are familiar with Object Oriented programming in JavaScript
Are familiar with JavaScript promises
Are interested in building full-stack web applications
Are interested in how user stories get translated into software design and implementation choices
Description

In this goal, you will build a simple to-do list app, where users can store their tasks in a database, see their tasks, and mark them complete.

This simple application is a great introduction to learning how the browser communicates with a server, and how the server communicates with a database.

You'll be working with the Express library for Node.js to help you scaffold and build the server-side logic of your application.

Most learners have used Postgres for their database and pg-promise for connecting to a Postgres database from a Node.js app.

If you are already experienced with this project, you may want to choose a different database such as MongoDB.

You may design your own UI, but it's probably better to copy someone else's design. After all, there are a few other to-do list apps out there ;). Here's one example using Google's Material Design that you could mimic:



**Context**

One of the main skills we seek to learn here at Learners Guild is the creation of full-stack web applications. This project is an excellent opportunity to see how all your various foundational skills will come together into a complete, functioning website.

When working on this goal, you'll encounter questions like:

How could the application logic be structured satisfy this user story?
How should the code be broken up and organized, and where should the different parts live?
When and where will users run into errors, and how should the app respond to them?
What should be tested and how?
What is the UI needed to satisfy this user story?
